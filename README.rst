=================================
 Paul's Personal Dev Environment
=================================

The collection of things I keep setting up over and over again on all the POSIX shell machines I'm living and working on these days.  

I'm documenting and VC-ing in the ways I am right now because it's practice for working habits.  Some of them I want to keep for myself, some of them are just the habits I have from my current job.

---------------
Version Control
---------------

I prefer distributed version control as a general rule.  I am currently conversant in git and Mercurial.  For non-technical users, I recommend Mercurial, mostly because there is TortoiseHg for Windows.  I prefer the power of git for myself, but I have shot myself in the history a number of times.  For my personal Mercurial setup, I use a collection of extensions which give me git-like functionality.  crecord is tthe most essential extension which is not distributed with Mercurial - especially since rebase is part of the Mercurial distribution.


--------
Keyboard
--------

I type on Dvorak.  For me, it feels more comfortable for typing English-like text for any length of time.  It's probably not as good as Maltron, but it's a simlple layout change on most systems, as opposed to carrying a $300+ physical device anywhere I go to type.

(Though, one of these days, I'd like to get that layout into my fingers, so I can have it set up on a home machine, and really use that for writing.)
